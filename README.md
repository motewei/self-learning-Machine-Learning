I'm an undergraduate student majored in Intelligent Science And Technology.  
Due to the scarcity of resources and opportunities in schools.I study AI on Internet.Thanks to the rich resources of the Internet and the courses offered by many excellent teachers and schools,I can travel in the sea of aritifical intelligence.  
I have just started learning Machine Learning and there are many unknowns and confusions.This repository will maintain the code and resources I have learned during the learning process, and I will try my best to master them.
